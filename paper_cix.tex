\begin{abstract}
The concept of the Internet Exchange Point\ac{IXP}, a
layer-2 \narrative{Perhaps prefer ``access-layer'' but maybe that's
  confusing overloading of ``access'' in the present context} fabric
central to the structure of the global Internet, is largely absent
from the development of community-driven collaborative network
infrastructure. The reason for this is dual. \acp{IXP} exist in
central, typically urban, environments where strong network
infrastructure ensures high levels of connectivity. Between rural and
remote regions, where networks are separated by distance, mountains,
and sea, no such infrastructure exists. In this paper we present RemIX
a distributed \acp{IXP} architecture designed for the community
network environment. We examine this praxis using an implementation in
Scotland, with suggestions for future development and research.

The concept of the \ac{IXP} is, so central to the
structure of the global Internet has so far been mostly absent
from the world of community-driven collaborative network
infrastructure development. The dual reasons for this are that
\acp{IXP} typically exist in a central place in an urban area
and community networks are often in rural and remote places,
with long distances, mountains and the sea to contend with.
In this paper we present RemIX a distributed \acp{IXP} 
architecture designed for the community network environment
and examine two instances of this praxis in Scotland and
Catalunya.

Salient differences between HUBS and Guifi:
\begin{itemize}
    \item HUBS lacks a centralising structure, a foundation, with an articulated social contract.
    \item Guifi itself does not provide Internet access
    \item HUBS is an IP Transit provider
    \item If anything, Guifi is more like a (larger version of) WHIX
    \item There is some conflict of interest in HUBS operating WHIX, which Guifi does not suffer from
\end{itemize}

Rural access networks are designed to bridge the `last-mile' broadband
gap in regions that are under-served by traditional broadband
providers. Their construction is bespoke, driven by their
beneficiaries, and determined by physical landscape, population
distribution, and monetary budget. Irrespective of their differences,
they are joined by one substantial challenge: connecting to the rest
of the Internet is prohibitively expensive. HUBS \textsc{c.i.c} was
created in Scotland to respond to this. It is a co-operative of access
network members that generates the economies of scale required to
afford backhaul and Internet transit. While intermediation at the IP
layer between the members and the Internet is required for reasons of
scale, it is neither necessary nor desirable amongst the member
networks themselves. In urban areas, networks could interconnect with
each other at an Internet Exchange Point (IXP). In Scotland where the
networks are scattered across 80,000km$^2$ of mountain, field, and sea
it is not so easy. We bridge this gap with a design for a distributed
Internet exchange for access networks in remote places. Doing so
allows for bilateral arrangements for mutual support and assistance
between these networks, and increases the resilience of access network
connectivity. We present the relevant components, and describe our
implementation, so that our efforts may be reproduced.

  \textbf{Autonomous System topology.} The members of a RemIX form a fully connected network where each may communicate
  with another over the exchange without intermediation. Unusually for \acp{IXP} it is common practice to provide Internet transit over the exchange for the vast majority of members that require this. Note as
  well the private interconnection, outwith the exchange, between Skyenet 
  and Hebnet. Such private interconnections are typically made as
  an optimisation where it is not feasible to do so efficiently over the exchange.
