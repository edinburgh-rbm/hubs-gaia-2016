% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\begin{abstract}
Rural access networks are designed to bridge the `last-mile' broadband gap in regions that are under-served by traditional broadband providers. Their construction is bespoke, driven by their beneficiaries, and determined by physical landscape, population distribution, and monetary budget. Irrespective of their differences, they are joined by one substantial challenge: connecting to the rest of the Internet is prohibitively expensive. HUBS \textsc{c.i.c} was created in Scotland to respond to this. It is a co-operative of access network members that generates the economies of scale required to afford backhaul and Internet transit. While intermediation at the IP layer between the members and the Internet is required for reasons of scale, it is neither necessary nor desirable amongst the member networks themselves. In urban areas, networks could interconnect with each other at an Internet Exchange Point (IXP). In Scotland where the networks are scattered across 80,000km$^2$ of mountain, field, and sea it is not so easy. We bridge this gap with a design for a distributed Internet exchange for access networks in remote places. Doing so allows for bilateral arrangements for mutual support and assistance between these networks, and increases the resilience of access network connectivity. We present the relevant components, and describe our implementation, so that our efforts may be reproduced.

  \textbf{Autonomous System topology.} The members of the RemIX in the West
  Highlands, WHIX form a fully connected network where each may communicate
  with another over the exchange without intermediation. HUBS is also present
  and unusually for IXPs will provide Internet transit over the exchange for
  those members that so require. In practice this is most of them. Note as
  well the private interconnection, outwith the exchange, between Skyenet 
  and Hebnet.
