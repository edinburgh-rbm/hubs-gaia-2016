In this section we describe the RemIX architecture.

\subsection{Design Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
    \item must behave like ethernet switch for pt to multipt comms 
    \item IX buildings do exactly this
    \item how to reproduce remotely?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Required Components}
\begin{itemize}
    \item AS number required
    \item ethernet circuits
    \item internally BGP (we used VPLS) to allow policies and police activity
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Structural Benefits}
\begin{itemize}
    \item provides default transit to Internet (useful because of IP limits - have to be careful about if/how to raise IP issue)
    \item BGP solves $n^2$ connects, gives bilateral arrangements
    \item (in our case) BGP is also the foundation of exchange fabric, i.e. pt2pt circuits that mimic ethernet
\end{itemize}
