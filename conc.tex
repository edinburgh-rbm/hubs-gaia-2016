The features of RemIX described above will be instantly recognisable
to anyone who has participated in a regular \ac{IXP}. This is by
design, as RemIX is an application of a structure that has allowed the
Internet to scale to the rural networking environment. Not only does
encapsulating small community networks in \acp{AS} mean that they can
present a uniform interface to a transit provider but also that it is
possible for them to cooperate and to share resources and yet for each
to retain the ability to operate their own network as they see
fit. This is very important because keeping as much of operations and
maintenance local is the only way they can be sustainable. In turn
this means that the internal details of each network should suit those
doing the work and what they are comfortable with.

A benefit of \ac{WHIX}' implementation choice of \ac{BGP}-\ac{VPLS}
for making the exchange fabric is that it is easy to offer auxilliary
point to point pseudo-wire services to its members. This is especially
useful for those networks who, for one reason or another, have need of
such a service for making connections \emph{internal} to their
networks. This is as simple as creating a distinct route target
bridged to two of their ports which results in the establishment of a
dedicated~\ac{VPLS} instance for them.
