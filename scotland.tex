11 small community networks, four of which have a history of
interconnecting and sharing network resources. They are spread over an
area of some 400km$^2$ \narrative{Is this number right?} making the
construction of an exchange fabric geographically ambitious. It is
called the \acf{WHIX}.

\subsection{RemIX in Scotland}

The two places in the region where long-distance ethernet circuits are
available on the mainland are the towns of Mallaig and Kyle of
Lochalsh. Circuits\footnote{At the time of writing, the circuit from
Mallaig is in place, and that from Kyle is planned.} from these sites
connect back to the Pulsant datacentre in Edinburgh to facilitate
remote peering --- and indeed the provision of Internet access via the
exchange point.

From these sites, a series of wireless ethernet circuits connects
seven other \ac{WHIX} points of presence as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:whixmap}.

  links, and orange lines leased 100Mbps or 1Gbps circuits. The areas
  enclosed with dotted lines correspond to the service areas of member
  networks. Note in particular how these service areas correspond more 
  closely to maritime features than landforms.
