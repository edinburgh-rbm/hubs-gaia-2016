  Diagram of the West Highland Internet Exchange. Red markers indicate
  the sites at which networks may connect, black lines indicate radio
  links, and orange lines leased 100Mbps or 1Gbps circuits. The areas
  enclosed with dotted lines correspond to the service areas of member
  networks. Note in particular how these service areas correspond more 
  closely to maritime features than landforms.
